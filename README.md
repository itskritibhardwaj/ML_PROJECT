# ML_PROJECT
This is my second project on machine learning.this project is based on bank increasing borrowers (asset customers) base to bring in more loan business and earn more through the interest on loans. So , the bank wants to convert the liability based customers to personal loan customers. In this i have predicted if the customer will take personal loan or not.In this i have used several libraries and used logistic regression model to classify this. And the last I have also compared various classification algorithm to chech the highest accuracy ,F1_score,and jaccard_similarity score.i have done the EDA (exploratory data analysis) part on tableau. For EDA part you can jump to my tableau workbook or can see ppt attached below.
